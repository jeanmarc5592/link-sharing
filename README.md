## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- Typescript

- Vercel
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- How to implement an authentication workflow using `Next-Auth`
- How to upload images using `cloudinary`
- `Tailwind CSS` is not as bad as I thought
- How to implement a drag and drop functionality in the frontend and the backend (especially in combination with a database)
- How to use `Prisma` as an ORM and how to integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline on Vercel
- How to spin up a database on vercel and use it inside the project
- How to query and mutate data from the backend using `react-query`
- Seperating the logic from frontend and the backend
- How to use `Next.js 14` after it's major update

### Useful resources

- [Drag and Drop in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-drag-and-drop/) - This helped me a lot for integrating the drag and drop functionality in the frontend.
- [Next Cloudinary](https://next.cloudinary.dev/) - This is an amazing package that makes the process of integrating and using `cloudinary` in your `Next.js` project much easier.
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Besides `Google` it offers a great help as your coding buddy.
